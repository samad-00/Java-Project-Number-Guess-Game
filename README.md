# Java-Project-Number-Guess-Game
A desktop-based Number Guessing Game developed using Java and Swing as part of my summer training internship. The project includes difficulty levels, hints, real-time feedback, guess counting, timers, and best-score storage. Designed to demonstrate core Java concepts, OOP, event handling, and GUI development.
